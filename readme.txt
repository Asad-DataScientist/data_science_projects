I have created this end to end data science project that walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website.

First built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

In second step wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 

The third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

During model building trying to cover almost all data science concepts such as 
Data load and cleaning, 
Outlier detection and removal, 
Feature engineering, 
Dimensionality reduction, 
Gridsearchcv for Hyperparameter tunning, 
K-Fold Cross Validation etc. 


Technology and tools used;
Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
